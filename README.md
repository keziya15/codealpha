ðŸ“ˆ TASK 2 Completed â€“ Stock Portfolio Tracker (CodeAlpha Internship) ðŸ’¼

As part of my CodeAlpha internship, I developed a Python-based Stock Portfolio Tracker that calculates the total investment value based on predefined stock prices.
âœ… Predefined stock prices stored in a dictionary.
âœ… User inputs stock symbols and quantities.
âœ… Calculates the total investment value dynamically.
âœ… Displays a detailed portfolio summary.
âœ… Option to save results to a .txt file for record keeping.
Excited to keep building more projects in my learning journey with CodeAlpha! ðŸš€
