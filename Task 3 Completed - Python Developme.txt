Task 3 Completed - Python Development Internship
(Code Alpha)
Project: Task Automation with Python Scripts
I recently built a small but powerful Python automation script to simplify repetitive work.
The project uses os, shutil, re, requests, and file handling to perform one of these tasks:
📂 Move all .jpg files from one folder to another.

📧 Extract all email addresses from a .txt file and save them separately.

🌐 Scrape the title of a fixed webpage and store it for reference.

This project demonstrates how a few lines of Python can save time, reduce manual work, and boost efficiency in real-life scenarios.
